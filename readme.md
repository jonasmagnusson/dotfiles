# Dotfiles

This is a collection of dotfiles I use for customizing tools I use on a day-to-day basis.

## Install

Clone this repository into your home folder:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/jonasmagnusson/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Run the setup script to symlink the dotfiles into your home directory. Already existing dotfiles will be backed up:

```bash
# Make executable and run script
chmod +x ~/.dotfiles/setup.sh
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
